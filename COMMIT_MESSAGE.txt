feat: Implement Semantic Release with GitHub Actions

This commit introduces automated releases using Semantic Release via a new GitHub Actions workflow.

- A new workflow file `.github/workflows/release.yml` has been created to handle the release process.
- The old `publish.yml` workflow has been removed as its functionality is now covered by Semantic Release.

This change streamlines the release process and ensures consistent versioning and changelog generation.
